Works with rocket 0.5.0 and above.

Look at the documentation and examples to learn more. ( TODO: Add documentation )

This is provided AS-IS and does not guarantee any reliability right now - thought it has been used to power some websites, notably [trackmy.games](https://trackmy.games).

* There are no tests at this time
* Logging/observability is minimal (and the admin UI is not open sourced)
* There's 0 documentation
